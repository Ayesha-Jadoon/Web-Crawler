            "Without limiting your waiver and release in Section 6, you agree to the following:a. Purpose. Any and all Disputes (as defined below) involving you and CC \u00c2\u00a0will be resolved through individual arbitration. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court. This Section 11 (the \"Arbitration Provision\") shall be broadly interpreted. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, this Section 11 does not apply to an action by either party to enjoin the infringement or misuse of its intellectual property rights, including copyright, trademark, patent or trade secret rights.b. Definitions. The term \"Dispute\" means any claim or controversy related to Site, Service, and/or Crawled Content, including but not limited to any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (2) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement; (3) claims that arise after the expiration or termination of these Terms; and (4) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. \u00c2\u00a0As used in this Arbitration Provision, \"CC\" means The Common \u00c2\u00a0Crawl Foundation and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and \"you\" means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Site, Service, and/or Crawled Content.c. Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with JAMS, formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., (\"JAMS\") by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267). You may deliver any required or desired notice to CC by mail to 9663 Santa Monica Blvd. #425, Beverly Hills, CA 90210.d. Right to Sue in Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, either you or CC may bring an individual action in a small claims court in the area where you access the Site, Services, and/or the Crawled Content if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.e. Arbitration Procedures. This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Arbitrations shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \"JAMS Rules\") as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify CC about your Dispute. You can obtain the JAMS Rules from the JAMS by visiting its website (www.jamsadr.com) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-352-5267). If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of these Terms, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. If there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the JAMS rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern. A single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute. Unless you and CC agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in Los Angeles, CA. \u00c2\u00a0 No discovery shall be permitted. \u00c2\u00a0The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator's essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator's award. An arbitrator's award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.f. Waiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS OR USERS, OR OTHER PERSONS. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.g. Arbitration Fees and Costs. \u00c2\u00a0If the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the JAMS's fees and costs shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and you shall reimburse CC for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. You may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration. You are responsible for your attorneys' fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys' fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor. Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, CC will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.h. Severability and Waiver of Jury Trial. If any part of subsection (f) of this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire Arbitration provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court. WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND CC AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW. If any other clause in this Arbitration Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Provision and the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be given full force and effect.i. Continuation. This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.j. Injunctive Relief. \u00c2\u00a0Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you acknowledge that any threatened or actual breach of this ToU regarding CC's intellectual property or proprietary rights, \u00c2\u00a0or other alleged infringement of a CC's intellectual property rights, may result in immediate, irreparable harm to CC for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and therefore CC may immediately seek equitable and/or injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (in addition to all other remedies available to CC at law or in equity).",
            "The failure of CC to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the ToU shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any of the provisions of the ToU are held invalid, unenforceable, or void by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the ToU remain in full force and effect. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.",
            "These ToU constitute the entire and only Agreement between you and CC with respect to the Service, and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and CC. Any and all other collateral representations, promises, and conditions; and any representation, warranty, promise or condition not incorporated herein or made as provided for in these ToU shall not be binding on CC.",

            "Today we are happy to announce cc-downloader, an experimental command-line tool for downloading Common Crawl data via https. cc-downloader is intended to be a user-friendly and polite downloader. It was made in response to the significant increase in downloads of our data in recent months. That was very exciting to see at first, especially in terms of the large rise in interest for our dataset. But it also makes it harder for some users to successfully download our data due to quirks of downloading from a high-traffic storage bucket.",
            "cc-downloader is our solution to this problem, enabling our users to continue downloading our data via https without issues. We have designed cc-downloader with a polite retry mechanism that allows our users to make sure that every single file requested is downloaded. It also implements jitter and exponential backoff strategies, in order to avoid overwhelming our infrastructure.",
            "If you wish to install cc-downloader, we have released pre-compiled binaries for all major operating systems and architectures. cc-downloader is written in Rust and is distributed as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrate\u00e2\u0080\u009d, so if you have cargo installed, you can install cc-downloader with the following command:",
            "Once you have installed cc-downloader, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that it has 2 sub-commands:",
            "First, download-paths downloads the file paths list for a given crawl and subset from our bucket, to a given destination folder path in your file system:",
            "This paths file will be (in this case) path/to/folder/wet.paths.gz.",
            "Next, download reads this file paths list and concurrently downloads the files to a given destination folder in your file system:",
            "This will preserve the tree structure that we use internally by default.",
            "\u00e2\u0080\u008dcc-downloader is still under active development, so if you find any issues or would like to submit a feature request, please visit its GitHub repository at https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-downloader/.",
            "Contributions are always welcome! We hope that with this tool our users will find it easier to download and use our data.",
            "Finally, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encountering any problems with cc-downloader that look like high traffic, you can check out our current traffic levels by looking at our Infrastructure Status Webpage."
